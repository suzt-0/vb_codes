*What is VB.NET?

The VB.NET stands for Visual Basic. Network Enabled Technologies. It is a simple, high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft in 2002. It is a successor of Visual Basic 6.0, that is implemented on the Microsoft .NET framework. Furthermore, it supports the OOPs concept, such as abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Therefore, everything in the VB.NET language is an object, including all primitive data types (Integer, String, char, long, short, Boolean, etc.), user-defined data types, events, and all objects that inherit from its base class. It is not a case sensitive language, whereas, C++, Java, and C# are case sensitive language.

Applications built using the VB.NET language are very reliable and scalable, relying on the .NET Framework to access all libraries that help to execute a VB.NET program. With this language, you can develop a fully object-oriented application that is similar to an application created through another language such as C++, Java, or C#. In addition, applications or programs of VB.NET are not only running on the window operating system but can also run on Linux or Mac OS.

The VB.NET language is designed in such a way that any new beginner or novice and the advanced programmer can quickly develop a simple, secure, robust, high performance of web, windows, console, and mobile application running on .NET Framework.
